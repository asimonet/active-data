	<h1>Active Data features</h1>
	<p>Active Data is a model and software that help managing distributed data life cycles.<br/>
	For any data item, its life cycle represents the operational steps it will go through from
	its creation to its deletion from a system: creation, writes, reads, replication, transfers,
	derivations, deletion, etc.</p>
	
	<h2>Life cycle model</h2>
	<p><img src="/img/example_1.png" style="float:right" alt="" title="" />
	Active Data offers a meta-model to formally represent life cycles. An Active Data model looks
	a lot like a Petri Network: data states are represented by cercles and one possible change
	from one state to another is represented by a rectangle. Cercles are called Places and
	rectangles are called transitions. Tokens on places represent the state of a data item and
	replication is represented with several tokens.<br/>Multiple tokens on different places
	represent the distributed state of data in several systems at the same time.
	</p>
	
	<br />
	<p><img src="/img/example_3.png" style="float:left" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
	Life cycle models can be composed together to model <b>more complex life cycles</b>.<br/><br/>
	For example, says that you have several replicas of the same data object on a storage service
	and you want to transfer it. The transfer service creates a life cycle just for the transfer
	(e.g. start, transferring, pause, restart, success, failure…); the storage service creates a
	different life cycle (e.g. create, write, read, move, replicate, split, delete…).<br/>
	Composing both, the whole life cycle will be exposed on a single view and Active Data
	automatically makes sense of the different data identifiers in different systems.</p>
	
	<h2>Programming model</h2>
	<p><img src="/img/example_4.png" style="float:right" alt="" title="" /><br />
	<br /><br />
	Active Data allows users to react to life cycle progression. Reacting
	can be getting <b>notifications</b> or <b>executing</b> arbitrary code when a transition in
	the model occurs.
	<br/><br/>
	Code is executed by clients independently of other clients in an <b>event driven</b> fashion.
	Data management tasks implemented with Active Data require very few code and are <b>implicitly
	parallel</b>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Runtime library</h2>
	<p>Active Data is implemented as a stand-alone Java library that provides:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an API to implement life cycle models;</li>
		<li>an API to provide handler code to be automatically executed when transitions are published;
		<li>a centralized service, the Active Data Service to receive transition publications from
		clients, forward them to other clients and orchestrate everything;</li>
		<li>an API to publish life cycle transitions to the Active Data Service.
	</ul>
	<p>The library is very lightweight, which makes it easy to integrate to your applications and to
	existing data management software.</p>
	
	<h2>Error checking</h2>
	
	<p>The Active Data Service takes life cycle models as input and is able to dynamically check that
	changes of data states are valid with respect to the model.<br/>
	The service maintains the global state of all data life cycles in the system; when a system performs
	an action on data, the service checks the action against the current global data state
	and decides if it legal or not. If the current data state is incompatible with the action reported
	by the system, an exception is raised.</p>
	
	<p>This feature enables to quickly detect abnormal operations and prevent your data to be in
	a state that is consistent with a particular system but not your personal workflow.</p>
	
	<h2>Life cycle catalog</h2>
	<p>Active Data provides a life cycle catalog that maintains the global state of your data. Say that your
	favourite data item is stored on an infrastructure and a computation using it is running on another;
	the state of both replicas can be queried from the Active Data Service using the client API. Decisions
	can be made locally based on the global state of your data. Because the service knows every life cycle
	transition that ocures and performs error checking, the the life cycles it maintains remains consistent
	over time.</p>
